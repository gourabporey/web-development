            Thoughtworks is a publicly owned, global technology company with 49
            offices in 18 countries.[3] It provides software design and
            delivery, and tools and consulting services. The company is closely
            associated with the movement for agile software development, and has
            contributed to open source products. Thoughtworks' business includes
            Digital Product Development Services,[4] Digital Experience[5] and
            Distributed Agile software development.[6]
          </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>1980s to 1990s</h3>
        <p>
          In the late 1980s, Roy Singham founded Singham Business Services as a
          management consulting company servicing the equipment leasing industry
          in a Chicago basement. According to Singham, after two-to-three years,
          Singham started recruiting additional staff and came up with the name
          Thoughtworks in 1990.[7] The company was incorporated under the new
          name in 1993 and focused on building software applications.[8] Over
          time, Thoughtworks' technology shifted from C++ and Forte 4GL in the
          mid-1990s to include Java in the late 1990s.
        </p>
        <h3>1990s to 2010s</h3>
        <p>
          Martin Fowler joined the company in 1999 and became its chief
          scientist in 2000.[9]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2001, Thoughtworks agreed to settle a lawsuit by Microsoft for
          $480,000 for deploying unlicensed copies of office productivity
          software to employees.[10]
        </p>
        <p>
          Also in 2001, Fowler, Jim Highsmith, and other key software figures
          authored the Agile Manifesto.[11] The company began using agile
          techniques while working on a leasing project.[12] Thoughtworks'
          technical expertise expanded with the .NET Framework in 2002,[13] C#
          in 2004, Ruby and the Rails platform in 2006.[14] In 2002,
          Thoughtworks chief scientist Martin Fowler wrote "Patterns of
          Enterprise Application Architecture" with contributions by
          ThoughtWorkers David Rice and Matthew Foemmel, as well as outside
          contributors Edward Hieatt, Robert Mee, and Randy Stafford.[15]
        </p>
        <p>
          Thoughtworks Studios was launched as its product division in 2006 and
          shut down in 2020. The division created, supported and sold agile
          project management and software development and deployment tools
          including Mingle,[16] Gauge(formerly Twist), Snap CI[17] and GoCD.[18]
        </p>
        <p>
          On 2 March 2007, Thoughtworks announced Trevor Mather as the new
          CEO.[19] Singham became Executive chairman. Also in March 2007,
          Rebecca Parsons assumed the role of Chief Technical Officer, having
          been with the company since 1999.[20][21] By 2008, Thoughtworks
          employed 1,000 people and was growing at the rate of 20–30% p.a., with
          bases around the world. Its clients included Microsoft, Oracle, major
          banks, and The Guardian newspaper.[22] Singham owned 97% of the common
          stock of the company.[22] By 2010, its clients included Daimler AG,
          Siemens and Barclays, and had opened a second headquarters in
          Bangalore.[23] In 2010, Singham opened Thoughtworks’ Fifth Agile
          Software Development Conference in Beijing.[24]
        </p>

        <h3>2010s to present</h3>
        <p>In 2010, Jim Highsmith joined Thoughtworks.[25]</p>
        <p>
          In April 2013, Thoughtworks announced a collective leadership
          structure and appointed four co-Presidents of the global
          organization.[26][27] The appointments followed the announcement that
          the then current CEO, Trevor Mather, was leaving Thoughtworks to take
          up the role of CEO for the used car sales business Trader Media
          Group.[28]
        </p>
        <p>
          In May 2013, Dr. David Walton was hired as Director of Global
          Health.[29] Walton has done work in Haiti since 1999, including
          helping establish a 300-room, solar-powered hospital and the
          establishment of a noncommunicable disease clinic.[30] In 2015, Guo
          Xiao, who started as a developer in Thoughtworks China in 1999, became
          the chief executive officer and President. Also in 2015, Chinese
          marketing data company AdMaster acquired Chinese online form
          automation platform JinShuJu from Thoughtworks.[31][32] In early 2016,
          Thoughtworks closed their Toronto offices, the last remaining Canadian
          office after the closure of their Calgary offices in 2013. They have
          since reopened the Toronto office.[33] Singham sold the company to
          British private equity firm Apax Partners in 2017 for an undisclosed
          sum,[24] by which time it had 4,500 employees across 15 countries,
          including South Africa and Uganda.[34][35] Singham left the company.
          Its chief scientist, Martin Fowler, wrote that Singham had not been
          involved in the running of the business for some years by that time:
        </p>

        <h2>Corporate philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Thoughtworks launched its Social Impact Program in 2009.[44] This
          program provided pro-bono or other developmental help for non-profits
          and organizations with socially-driven missions. Clients included
          Democracy Now! (mobile content delivery site), Human Network
          International (mobile data collection), and the Institute for
          Reproductive Health (SMS-based fertility planner).[45][46] In 2010,
          Thoughtworks provided software engineering services for Grameen
          Foundation's Mifos platform.[47] Translation Cards is an open source
          Android app that helps field workers and refugees communicate more
          effectively and confidently[promotion?]. With the help of Google
          volunteers, Mercy Corps partnered with Thoughtworks and UNHCR to
          create the app.[48][49]
